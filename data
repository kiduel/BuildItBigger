    "long_story": "Most people coming to me for therapy obviously come with some immediate concern at hand. However innately they appear to be holding the same question in their hearts as all of you who read this perhaps also do. endofP . Some part of any counselling process often gets dedicated to helping people identify the happiness that is already there in their lives, in the present, and to experience it for what it is worth.endofP
As the story shows, Happiness is not a distant bird somewhere in some bush. It is often perching right upon our own shoulder. Often we fail to recognize it unless it flies away or as in the above case case, gets taken away.endofP
I wish all of you who read this a pleasant discovery of this already existing happiness, atleast for today…endofP",

What are you doing, young man? He asked.endofp
If the starfish are still on the beach when the sun rises, they will die,” the boy answered.endofp
That is ridiculous. There are thousands of miles of beach and millions of starfish. It doesn’t matter how many you throw in; you can’t make a difference.endofp",
